Recap
==============
This week was the first week that I used this system and thus far I really like it.  Using git / github / md is a surprisingly good way to sync files from pc to my phone, with the help of [sGit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.sheimi.sgit).

Because this was my first week, I am writing this file for the first time so the format and my process may change.

It appears that blogging has been the focus of my last few days.  After recently moving my blog from Wordpress to Jekyll, I moved again to Pelican this morning.  Thus far these moves have been a cycle of continuous improvements.
