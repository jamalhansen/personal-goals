Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source.

Inspired by [Una](http://una.im/personal-goals-guide/) I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

1. Work more with Open Source
2. Write more blog posts
3. Learn Python
4. Teach my kids to code in Java
5. Learn continuously
6. Be kind
